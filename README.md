# Implicit Conversion Error in Scala

This example demonstrates a common error in Scala involving implicit conversions. The code defines a class `MyClass` with a generic type parameter `T`. The `myMethod` function uses an implicit conversion from `T` to `Int`. However, in the `main` function, an instance of `MyClass` is created with a `String` value. Since there's no implicit conversion defined from `String` to `Int`, calling `myMethod` results in a compiler error.

## Solution
The solution involves providing an implicit conversion from `String` to `Int` (though this might not always be appropriate, depending on the context.  For demonstration purposes, we show a conversion, acknowledging it may not always be semantically correct). This requires defining an implicit function that performs the conversion.  Better approaches might involve using different type parameters or refining the design of the `MyClass` and `myMethod` to prevent this implicit conversion from being necessary.
